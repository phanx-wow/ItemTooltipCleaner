Features
--------

Item Tooltip Cleaner compacts equipment bonuses and removes extraneous
text from item tooltips, including item levels, socketing instructions,
stack purchase instructions, vendor sell values while you're not at a
vendor, "Made by" tags, and "Soulbound" lines. It also recolors
enchantment lines to help set them apart from equipment bonus lines.

Item Tooltip Cleaner is compatible with RatingBuster and other addons
that read stats from the tooltip. It is based on dlemvigh's addon
PhoenixTooltip, which is no longer maintained.

Type ``/itc`` for options, or browse to the Item Tooltip Cleaner panel
in the standard Interface Options window.


Localization
------------

Item Tooltip Cleaner is compatible with English, Deutsch, Español, and
Français game clients.

Item Tooltip Cleaner is translated into English and Español.
